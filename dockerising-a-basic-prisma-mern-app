step 1
- go to the root and create a Docker file and .dockerignore
add the below code

CODE STARTE //
FROM node:18-alpine

  // creates dir called app
WORKDIR /app

  // copies the current to app dir
COPY . .

// update this as your req, here its node and prisma
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build
RUN npx prisma generate

  // expose the port in which you want to run this container
EXPOSE 3000


  // commands to run the container
CMD [ "node", "dist/index.js" ]

CODE ENDS //

or
// better implementation which caches
CODE STARTs //
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package* .
COPY ./prisma .

RUN npm install
RUN npx prisma generate

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "node", "dist/index.js" ]

CODE ENDS //

step 2
- Now from the same dir, "docker build -t prisma-be-app ." // this will create a image in the local with the name prisma-be-app

step 3
- Now run this command to start run the above image "docker run -p 3001:3000 primsa-be-app" // make sure the name is same as the image name and the port is exposed on the image  
or 
"docker run -p 3001:3000 -e DB_URL="cyuf" primsa-be-app" // add the flag -e for adding env to the container
