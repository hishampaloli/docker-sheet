If there is not volume in the mongo container, whenever we restart the image, all the data will be gone. To avoid such a situation we have to attach volumes to the container while running,
"docker run -p 20001:27017 mongo" // this will loose data with restart
  
step 1
- run "docker volume create 'vol_name'"

step 2
- attach the above created volume while starting a container
- "docker run -v vol_name:/data/db -p 20001:27017 mongo" // this will attach the volume and the data wont be lost
